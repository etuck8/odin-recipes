            <li>8 ounces egg noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound beef tenderloin, trimmed of fat and sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, sliced</li>
            <li>4 ounces white mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 (10.5) can condensed beef broth, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white wine</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons low-fat sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons reduced-fat cream cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat.  Cook noodles according to package instructions.  Drain and reserve.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, season meat with salt and pepper.  Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add beef; brown on all sides and then push to one side of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add onion and mushrooms, cooking until tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.  Push to the side with beef.  In a small bowl, combine cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold beef broth.  Add to the skillet and mix with juices in the pan to deglaze.</li>
            <li>Pour in remaining beef broth.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and stir in mustard, garlic, wine, and Worcestershire sauce.  Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Two minutes before beef is done, stir in sour cream and cream cheese.  Stir well and allow beef to finish cooking in the sauce.  Let meat rest 5 minutes and serve.</li>
        </ol>
